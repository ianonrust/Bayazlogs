# Bayazlogs
Private Repository for my personal project of creating a clone of warcraftlogs.com with some improvements I wish were in the original website.
Initial List of improvements I have in mind
1. Rankings for Death percentages on progress
2. Links to alt characters of the same account wow account on personal rankings page
3. More customizable rankings page to add feature to look at certain important add damage and in certain phases
4. Default Rankings page is more relevant to ethical and good performance (Mug'zee p2 damage only, shocker damage excluded for classes that don't hit these from range, etc.)
